# Local Food Backend - Setup Execution Log

## Project Overview
Executing the local development plan for Local Food backend without Docker, implementing mock services for Saleor dependencies.

## Execution Timeline

### 2025-06-27 - Setup Execution Start

#### 16:35 - Initialization
- Starting execution of LOCAL_FOOD_LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
- Target: Complete no-Docker local development environment
- Current directory: /home/hek/saleor/

#### 16:40 - Environment Assessment
- Python 3.12.3 available at /usr/bin/python3
- System has externally managed Python environment (PEP 668)
- Poetry not installed system-wide
- Need to work within existing Saleor poetry environment
- Using existing poetry setup from Saleor project

#### 16:42 - Dependency Installation Strategy
- Working within existing Saleor poetry environment
- Will use poetry to install additional development dependencies
- Avoiding system-wide pip installations due to externally managed environment

#### 16:45 - Mock Services Implementation
Created comprehensive mock system:

**Mock Models** (`mocks.py`):
- `MockChannel`: Multi-channel support mock
- `MockOrder`: Order management mock with status workflow
- `MockProduct/MockProductVariant`: Product catalog mocks
- `MockWarehouse`: Inventory location mock
- `MockUser`: User authentication mock with permission system

**Mock Services** (`mock_services.py`):
- `MockModelWithMetadata`: Base model with metadata support
- `mock_permission_required`: Permission decorator that always allows access
- `MockWebhookEventAsyncType`: Webhook event constants
- `MockOrderPermissions/MockProductPermissions`: Permission classes
- `mock_send_mail`: Email service mock with console output

**Mock GraphQL** (`mock_graphql.py`):
- `MockLocalFoodError`: GraphQL error handling
- `MockConnection`: Pagination and connection mocks
- `mock_get_node_from_global_id`: Node resolution
- `MockBaseMutation`: Base mutation class for GraphQL

#### 16:50 - Local Development Settings
Created comprehensive development configuration (`local_development.py`):

**Database Configuration**:
- SQLite database for lightweight development
- Simplified authentication using MockUser model
- Dummy cache backend for development

**Application Setup**:
- Local Food app integration
- Debug toolbar enabled
- Console email backend
- Relaxed security settings for development

**Development Features**:
- Comprehensive logging configuration
- CORS enabled for frontend development
- GraphQL playground accessible
- Static and media file handling

#### 16:55 - Management Commands and Scripts
Created development automation tools:

**Management Command** (`setup_localfood_dev.py`):
- Automated mock data creation
- Database reset functionality
- Comprehensive test data including channels, products, orders
- Progress reporting and error handling

**Development Server Script** (`run_local_dev.py`):
- One-command startup for complete environment
- Dependency checking and validation
- Automatic database migration
- Mock data setup with reset option
- Superuser creation
- Redis connectivity check
- Useful development information display

#### 17:00 - Debug Tools and Testing Infrastructure
Implemented comprehensive debugging and testing support:

**Debug Utilities** (`debug_utils.py`):
- System status endpoint with memory usage monitoring
- Manual task triggering for background processes
- Test data creation endpoints for different scenarios
- GraphQL information and sample queries
- Error handling and JSON response formatting

**URL Configuration** (`urls.py`):
- `/debug/status/` - System health monitoring
- `/debug/trigger-task/` - Manual task execution
- `/debug/create-test-data/` - Dynamic test data creation
- `/debug/graphql-info/` - GraphQL development assistance

**Development Commands** (`dev_commands.py`):
- Automated testing with pytest integration
- Code quality tools (ruff, mypy)
- Database management (migrate, reset)
- Test data creation and management
- Development server management
- Setup validation and health checks

**Factory Classes** (`factories.py`):
- Complete factory system using factory_boy
- Mock data factories for all Saleor dependencies
- Local Food model factories for comprehensive testing
- `create_full_test_scenario()` for complete integration testing
- Realistic test data generation with Faker integration
