# Local Food App Implementation Log

## Project Overview
Implementing a local food Django app that integrates with Saleor's e-commerce backend to provide F&B-specific functionality.

## Implementation Timeline

### 2025-06-27 - Project Initialization

#### 15:30 - Directory Structure Creation
- Created main Django app directory: `saleor/localfood/`
- Starting implementation of F&B-specific backend functionality
- Target: Full integration with Saleor's GraphQL API and multi-channel architecture

#### 15:35 - Django App Structure Initialization
- Created Django app configuration in `apps.py`
- Initialized empty `__init__.py` for package recognition
- Started implementing core F&B models in `models.py`

#### 15:40 - F&B Models Implementation
Created comprehensive F&B-specific models:
- **Kitchen**: Restaurant kitchen management with capacity and prep times
- **KitchenOrder**: Order tracking within kitchen operations with status workflow
- **ScheduledOrder**: Future delivery/pickup scheduling with time windows
- **PerishableStock**: Inventory management for food items with expiry tracking
- **MenuTimeSlot**: Time-based menu availability (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- **DeliveryZone**: Geographic delivery areas with pricing and postal code coverage

Key Features Implemented:
- UUID primary keys following Saleor patterns
- Proper database indexing for query optimization
- ModelWithMetadata integration for extensibility
- Foreign key relationships with Saleor core models (Order, Channel, ProductVariant, Warehouse)
- Business logic methods (is_expired, available_quantity, is_available_now)
- Database constraints for data integrity

#### 15:50 - GraphQL API Implementation
Created comprehensive GraphQL API layer:

**GraphQL Types** (`types.py`):
- **Kitchen**: Full GraphQL type with metadata support
- **KitchenOrder**: Order tracking with status and timing
- **ScheduledOrder**: Future delivery/pickup with time windows
- **PerishableStock**: Expiry tracking with computed fields (available_quantity, is_expired, days_until_expiry)
- **MenuTimeSlot**: Time-based availability with weekday display
- **DeliveryZone**: Geographic coverage with postal code parsing

**Mutations** - Kitchen Management:
- `KitchenCreate/Update`: Full CRUD operations with validation
- `KitchenOrderUpdateStatus`: Status workflow management with automatic completion timestamps
- `AssignOrderToKitchen`: Order-to-kitchen assignment with webhook support

**Mutations** - Scheduled Orders:
- `ScheduledOrderCreate/Update`: Future order scheduling with time validation
- `UpdateDeliveryWindow`: Delivery time window management

**Mutations** - Perishable Stock:
- `PerishableBatchCreate/Update`: Batch tracking with expiry validation
- `MarkBatchExpired`: Inventory lifecycle management
- `ReservePerishableStock/ReleasePerishableStock`: Stock reservation system

**GraphQL Schema** (`schema.py`):
- Complete query and mutation organization
- Filtering and connection support
- `expiring_stock` specialized query for inventory alerts
- Proper permission decorators and webhook events

#### 16:00 - Features Implemented
- **Permission Integration**: Uses Saleor's existing permission system
- **Webhook Support**: Custom webhook events for kitchen and stock management
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive business logic validation
- **Relationship Management**: Proper foreign key handling with Saleor core models
- **GraphQL Best Practices**: Relay-style connections, proper error handling

#### 16:10 - Testing Framework Implementation
Created comprehensive test suite:

**Model Tests** (`test_models.py`):
- **Kitchen Tests**: Creation, string representation, relationships
- **KitchenOrder Tests**: Status workflow, estimated completion calculation
- **ScheduledOrder Tests**: Time validation, pickup vs delivery logic
- **PerishableStock Tests**: Expiry logic, available quantity calculations, FIFO properties
- **MenuTimeSlot Tests**: Time-based availability, weekday handling
- **DeliveryZone Tests**: Postal code coverage, geographic logic
- **Constraint Tests**: Database integrity validation, positive quantities

**GraphQL Tests** (`test_mutations.py`, `test_queries.py`):
- **Mutation Tests**: Full CRUD operations with permission validation
- **Query Tests**: Data retrieval with proper filtering and relationships
- **Permission Tests**: Access control verification
- **Error Handling Tests**: Validation error scenarios
- **Business Logic Tests**: Time-based scheduling, stock reservation

**Test Features**:
- pytest fixtures for consistent test data
- Permission-based testing with staff and regular users
- Mock time testing for time-sensitive operations
- Database transaction isolation
- GraphQL response validation

#### 16:20 - Background Tasks Implementation
Created Celery task system (`tasks.py`):

**Inventory Management Tasks**:
- `check_expiring_stock`: Monitor stock expiry with email notifications
- `auto_expire_stock`: Automatic cleanup of expired inventory
- `optimize_stock_allocation`: FIFO optimization recommendations

**Kitchen Operations Tasks**:
- `update_kitchen_order_estimates`: Dynamic completion time calculation
- `process_scheduled_orders`: Automatic kitchen assignment for scheduled orders
- `generate_kitchen_performance_report`: Analytics and reporting

**System Maintenance Tasks**:
- `cleanup_old_kitchen_orders`: Database cleanup for performance
- `send_expiry_notification`: Email alerting system

**Task Features**:
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails
- Error handling with detailed reporting
- Email notification system integration
- Performance optimization with bulk operations

#### 16:25 - Implementation Summary

**Local Food App Complete Implementation:**

**Core Components Delivered:**
1. **Django Models** (`saleor/localfood/models.py`): 6 comprehensive F&B models with business logic
2. **GraphQL API** (`saleor/graphql/localfood/`): Complete API layer with 15+ mutations and queries
3. **Testing Suite** (`tests/`): 100+ test cases covering models and GraphQL operations
4. **Background Tasks** (`tasks.py`): 8 Celery tasks for automation and maintenance
5. **App Configuration** (`apps.py`): Django app setup ready for integration

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Kitchen Management**: Multi-kitchen support with capacity and workflow tracking
- **Scheduled Ordering**: Future delivery/pickup with time window validation
- **Perishable Inventory**: FIFO tracking with expiry monitoring and automation
- **Menu Time Slots**: Time-based item availability (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
